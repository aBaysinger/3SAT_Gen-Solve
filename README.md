# 3SAT_Gen-Solve
A three variable per clause SAT generator and solver

The basis for this project is a simplification of the NP-Complete Satisfiability Problem.

This program first generates random logical expressions with 1-20 clauses where each clause has 3 variables.
The user is then prompted to assign true/false values to each variable in the expression.
The expression is then evaluated for correctness with the given Boolean values.

For more background information refer to the included PDF that details the project's criteria and requirements.

This is a console program to be run with Python2.
